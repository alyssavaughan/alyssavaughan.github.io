This is my home page and my name is Alyssa Vaughan! I am a math major at CSUF and below are my favorite CPSC projects. 

## Computer Science Projects

Lab 3 Part-1
  
**This was one of my favorite labs because I felt like this was the first lab I really started to understand and incorporate what I was learning into actual code. It was an easy lab looking back on it now, however, I took great pride in the code actually running and being able to produce what the directions had asked for. It was also fun because my lab partner and I were working together on it, so whenever I had questions or he had questions, we could help each other. 

Lab 4 Part-2 

  This lab was fun because we created a game using conditionals and if/else statements. It was very easy to follow along and although we had some challenges with the formatting, at the end of the day, this was one of the main labs that gave me confidence in my ability to code if/else statements. My partner and I also worked really well together in this lab and we were able to communicate and problem solve. 

Lab 10 Part-1

  This lab was interesting and, similarly to Lab 4, I thought this lab really helped me solidify my understanding of for loops. It was interesting to see how it compared to writing script functions in Matlab. I thought that I really understood this lab and I was satisfied to see the code run successfully.
